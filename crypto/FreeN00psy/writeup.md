## Free n00psy 

### Description

I found data left by n00psy who was analysing a security lock before getting captured.  

Noopsy might have been able to glitch its RNG.
This [document](https://web.archive.org/web/20250505090133/https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-186.pdf) was also laying around.   

Can you help me recover the secret to clone a security badge and open the secure door to free n00psy.
